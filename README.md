## Description
This Python program is a financial calculator that allows users to calculate either the amount of interest they'll earn on their investment or the amount they'll have to pay on a home loan. Users input values such as deposit amount, interest rate, investing years, and type of interest calculation for investments, or present value of the house, interest rate, and number of months to repay the bond for home loans. The program then calculates and outputs the total amount or monthly repayment based on the input.

## Installation

To use the financial calculator program, simply download the `financial_calculator.py` file and run it on your local machine. This program requires Python 3 to be installed.

## Usage

To use the financial calculator program, run the `financial_calculator.py` file on your local machine. The program will prompt you to choose either the investment calculator or the home loan repayment calculator.

### Investment Calculator

If you choose the investment calculator, the program will ask you to input the following values:

- Deposit amount
- Interest rate (only the number of the interest without percentage)
- Number of investing years
- Type of interest calculation (simple or compound)

The program will then calculate the total amount of interest you'll earn on your investment based on the input values and output the result.

### Home Loan Repayment Calculator

If you choose the home loan repayment calculator, the program will ask you to input the following values:

- Present value of the house
- Interest rate (only the number of the interest without percentage)
- Number of months you plan to take to repay the bond

The program will then calculate the amount you'll have to pay on your home loan each month based on the input values and output the result.
